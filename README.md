# Adjucipes

This CLI tool allows the creation of abstract datapacks for recipe management
in Packwiz modpacks.

#### Long Explanation of why

> Why would anyone use this? We already have _\<Insert great alternative\>_!

For a long time, mods like KubeJS or CraftTweaker have been used in order to
customize recipes for modpacks. In the meantime, Mojang has introduced and
improved datapacks. With mc1.21 where item components have been introduced,
Minecraft has reached a new peak in customization.

Those mods are obsolete by now and only stand in the way of the modpack creator
by having cryptic design desitions, biased choises, the missing power of
porting over to version XY or not providing a stable and sane API.

This project is meant to fix most of these issues _(with the exception of being
biased because this tool will support Lua)_.
